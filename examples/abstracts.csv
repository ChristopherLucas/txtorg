"Two pervasive beliefs have given nuclear weapons a bad name: that nuclear deterrence is highly problematic, and that a breakdown in deterrence would mean Armageddon. Both beliefs are misguided and suggest that nearly half a century after Hiroshima, scholars and policy makers have yet to grasp the full strategic implications of nuclear weaponry. I contrast the logic of conventional and nuclear weaponry to show how nuclear weapons are in fact a tremendous force for peace and afford nations that possess them the possibility of security at reasonable cost.","Kenneth N. Waltz","Nuclear Myths and Political Realities",1990,"American Political Science Review",84,3
"While contemporary political science (as, for example, in such subjects as political socialization, studies of public opinion, etc.) tends to emphasize the study of values and tastes (because of an assumption that political outcomes - like market outcomes - are determined by the amalgamation of individual preferences), the older tradition of political science emphasized the study of institutions. The line of research in political theory followed during the last generation has involved seeking an equilibrium of tastes; but it has revealed that such an equilibrium exists only rarely, if at all. The inference then is that prudence in research directs the science of politics toward the investigation of empirical regularities in institutions, which, though congealed tastes, are 'unstable constants' amenable to scientific investigation.","William H. Riker","Implications from the Disequilibrium of Majority Rule for the Study of Institutions",1980,"American Political Science Review",74,2
"What is 'power'? Most people have an intuitive notion of what it means. But scientists have not yet formulated a statement of the concept of power that is rigorous enough to be of use in the systematic study of this important social phenomenon. Power is here defined in terms of a relation between people, and is expressed in simple symbolic notation. From this definition is developed a statement of power comparability, or the relative degree of power held by two or more persons. With these concepts it is possible for example, to rank members of the United States Senate according to their "power" over legislation on foreign policy and on tax and fiscal policy.","Robert A. Dahl","The Concept of Power",1957,"Behavioral Science",2,3
"This article aims at defining the concept of “semi-presidential government” and detailing the diversity of its practices. There are in fact three types of semi-presi- dential regimes: the president can be a mere figurehead, or he may be all-powerful or again he can share his power with parliament. Using four parameters - the con- tent of the constitution, tradition and circumstances, the composition of the parlia- mentary majority and the position of the president in relation to the majority - the author seeks to explain why similar constitutions are applied in a radically different manner.","Maurice Duverger","A New Political System Model: Semi-Presidential Government",1980,"European Journal of Political Research",8,2
"There is something of a paradox in the findings of public opinion research that those individuals who shift their political position from one election to another frequently have less information about the political situation and the issues than persons whose attitudes and positions remain relatively unchanged. This runs contrary to the common assumption that changes in political attitudes and behavior occur in response to communication of information and arguments about the principal candidates and the issues on which they are divided. Here is an extended discussion of the question.","Philip E. Converse","Information Flow and the Stability of Partisan Attitudes",1962,"Public Opinion Quarterly",26,4
"This essay first specifies and describes the behavioral and information cost assumptions that underlie instrumental rationality and the consequent a-institutional world of neoclassical theory and contrasts these assumptions to those that underpin a theory of institutions and transaction costs. It then explores the characteristics of political markets, characterizing the costs of transacting in political markets and the role of ideology in shaping political choices. Finally, it explores the implications of a transaction cost framework for the performance of polities and economies over time.","Douglass C. North","A Transaction Cost Theory of Politics",1990,"Journal of Theoretical Politics",2,4
