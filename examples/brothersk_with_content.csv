The man who lies to himself and listens to his own lie comes to such a pass that he cannot distinguish the truth within him or around him and so loses all respect for himself and for others. And having no respect he ceases to love and in order to occupy and distract himself without love he gives way to passions and coarse pleasures and sinks to bestiality in his vices all from continual lying to other men and to himself,2,2
All this exile to hard labor and formerly with floggings does not reform anyone and above all does not even frighten almost any criminal and the number of crimes not only does not diminish but increases all the more. Surely you will admit that. And it turns out that society thus is not protected at all for although the harmful member is mechanically cut off and sent away far out of sight another criminal appears at once to take his place perhaps even two others. If anything protects society even in our time and even reforms the criminal himself and transforms him into a different person again it is Christ's law alone which manifests itself in the acknowledgement of one's own conscience,2,5
You're a Karamazov too! In your family sensuality is carried to the point of fever. So these three sensualists are now eyeing each other with knives in their boots. The thereof them are at loggerheads and maybe you're the fourth,2,7
I'm a Karamazov. . . . when I fall into the abyss I go straight into it head down and heels up and I'm even pleased that I'm falling in such a humiliating position and for me I find it beautiful. And so in that very shame I suddenly begin a hymn. Let me be cursed let me be base and vile but let me also kiss the hem of that garment in which my God is clothed; let me be following the devil at the same time but still I am also your son Lord and I love you and I feel a joy without which the world cannot stand and be,3,3
Viper will eat viper and it would serve them both right!,3,9
My friends ask gladness from God. Be glad as children as birds in the sky. And let man's sin not disturb you in your efforts do not fear that it will dampen your endeavor and keep it from being fulfilled do not say 'Sin is strong impiety is strong the bad environment is strong and we are lonely and powerless the bad environment will dampen us and keep our good endeavor from being fulfilled.' Flee from such despondency my children! There is only one salvation for you: take yourself up and make yourself responsible for all the sins of men. For indeed it is so my friend and the moment you make yourself sincerely responsible for everything and everyone you will see at once that it is really so that it is you who are guilty on behalf of all and for all. Whereas by shifting your own laziness and powerlessness onto others you will end by sharing in Satan's pride and murmuring against God,4,3
his whole heart blazed up and turned towards some kind of light and he wanted to live and live to go on and on along some path towards the new beckoning light and to hurry hurry right now at once!,4,8
Everything is permitted,4,8
Just know one thing Rakitka I may be wicked but still I gave an onion,7,3
