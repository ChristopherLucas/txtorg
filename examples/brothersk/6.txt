My friends ask gladness from God. Be glad as children as birds in the sky. And let man's sin not disturb you in your efforts do not fear that it will dampen your endeavor and keep it from being fulfilled do not say 'Sin is strong impiety is strong the bad environment is strong and we are lonely and powerless the bad environment will dampen us and keep our good endeavor from being fulfilled.' Flee from such despondency my children! There is only one salvation for you: take yourself up and make yourself responsible for all the sins of men. For indeed it is so my friend and the moment you make yourself sincerely responsible for everything and everyone you will see at once that it is really so that it is you who are guilty on behalf of all and for all. Whereas by shifting your own laziness and powerlessness onto others you will end by sharing in Satan's pride and murmuring against God
