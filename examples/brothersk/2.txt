All this exile to hard labor and formerly with floggings does not reform anyone and above all does not even frighten almost any criminal and the number of crimes not only does not diminish but increases all the more. Surely you will admit that. And it turns out that society thus is not protected at all for although the harmful member is mechanically cut off and sent away far out of sight another criminal appears at once to take his place perhaps even two others. If anything protects society even in our time and even reforms the criminal himself and transforms him into a different person again it is Christ's law alone which manifests itself in the acknowledgement of one's own conscience
