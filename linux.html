  <p>If you are using a Linux distribution, the installation process is fairly straightforward (isn't this why we're using Linux, after all?). 
    txtorg depends on PyLucene, which depends on gcc/g++, the JDK, Ant, and the Python development packages. If you're using Ubuntu/Debian, 
    there is a PyLucene deb that you can install. Otherwise, you'll have to build PyLucene from source, as well as any missing dependencies. After satisfying
    the dependencies, you may install txtorg as you would any other Python package. We'll first show you how to install the PyLucene deb 
    file, then how to install PyLucene from source. 
    
  <h2>
    <a name="linux-installation" class="anchor" href="#linux-installation"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>PyLucene Installation Instructions for Ubuntu/Debian</h2>
  <p>You can either install PyLucene with APT or you can download the deb and install it. The former is probably best.</p>
  
  <h3>
    <a name="linux-installation" class="anchor" href="#linux-installation"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>APT</h3>
  
  <p>First, confirm that the repository contains PyLucene Version 3. You can do this from terminal with the following commend.<pre><code>$ apt-cache policy pylucene</code></pre>
    If that returned PyLucene Version 3.X.X, install PyLucene with the following command.</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo apt-get install pylucene</code></pre>
<p>And that should do it!</p>

  <h3>
    <a name="linux-installation" class="anchor" href="#linux-installation"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installing the Deb</h3>
  
  <p>If your repository doesn't contain PyLucene Version 3, you can do the following. This will download and install the source package, using wget. If you 
  are not running a 64-bit machine, change the link accordingly.</p>

<pre><code>$ wget http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/pool/main/p/pylucene/pylucene_3.5.0-1.2_amd64.deb
$ sudo dpkg -i pylucene_3.5.0-1.2_amd64.deb</code></pre>

  <h2>
    <a name="linux-installation" class="anchor" href="#linux-installation"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Building PyLucene from Source</h2>
  <p>If you are using a distribution of Linux other than Ubuntu/Debian, you'll have to install PyLucene and its dependencies from source. Or, you may 
    simply prefer to build from source. Assuming that you're using Aptitude and that the dependencies are in your repository, install the dependencies
    as follows in the code block below. If you're using another package management system or if the packages are not in your repos, you'll have to edit the 
    process accordingly.
  
<pre><code>$ sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk ant g++ python-dev</code></pre>

    Next, you need to build PyLucene. First, download PyLucene
    3 <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/pylucene/install.html">here</a> (any
    version 3 release will do). From a shell, navigate to the
    directory in which you saved the tarball. Then edit the Makefile
    and install PyLucene. These steps are displayed below.</p>
  
<pre><code>$ cd this_is_where/I_saved_my_tarball
$ tar -zxvf pylucene-[PyLucene Version Here]-src.tar.gz
$ cd pylucene-4.5.1-1/jcc
$ sudo python setup.py build
$ cd ..</code></pre>
  
  <p>Next, in a text editor, you need to edit the Makefile by
    uncommenting the section of code shown in the block below.  Note
    that you'll uncomment a different portion of code if you're using
    a 32-bit machine.</p>
  
<pre><code># Linux (Ubuntu 11.10 64-bit, Python 2.7.2, OpenJDK 1.7, setuptools 0.6.16)
# Be sure to also set JDK['linux2'] in jcc's setup.py to the JAVA_HOME value
# used below for ANT (and rebuild jcc after changing it).
PREFIX_PYTHON=/usr
ANT=JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-i386 /usr/bin/ant
PYTHON=$(PREFIX_PYTHON)/bin/python
JCC=$(PYTHON) -m jcc --shared
NUM_FILES=4	    
</code></pre>
  
  <p>Back in the terminal, finish the PyLucene installation process by issuing the following commands.</p>
  
<pre><code>$ make
$ sudo make install
</code></pre>

    <a name="linux-installation" class="anchor" href="#linux-installation"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installing txtorg</h2>
  <p>Now that you've met the dependencies for the package, you can install txtorg locally as you would any other Python module.</p>

<pre><code>$ wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/ChristopherLucas/txtorg/tarball/master -O - | tar xz
$ cd ChristopherLucas-txtorg-5b83cbe/
$ python setup.py --user 
</code></pre>
