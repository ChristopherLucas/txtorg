  <p>If you are using a Linux distribution, the installation process
    is fairly straightforward. txtorg depends on PyLucene, which
    depends on gcc/g++, the JDK, Ant, and the Python development
    packages. If you're using Ubuntu/Debian, there is a PyLucene deb
    that you can install, which will automatically install any missing
    dependencies. Otherwise, you'll have to build PyLucene from
    source, as well as any missing dependencies. After satisfying the
    dependencies, you may install txtorg as you would any other Python
    package. We'll first show you how to install the PyLucene deb
    file</a>, both <a href="http://txtorg.org/linux.html#apt">using
    APT</a> and <a href="http://txtorg.org/linux.html#dpkg">using
    dpkg</a>, then how to <a href="http://txtorg.org/linux.html#source">install PyLucene from source</a>. You only need
    to do one of these. Then, we'll show you how to <a href="http://txtorg.org/linux.html#txtorg-install">install txtorg</a>.
    
  <h2>
    <a name="Ubuntu" class="anchor" href="#deb"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>PyLucene Installation Instructions for Ubuntu/Debian</h2>
  <p>You can either install PyLucene with APT or you can download the deb and install it. The former is probably best but we'll describe both for good measure.</p>
  
  <h3>
    <a name="apt" class="anchor" href="#linux-installation"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>APT</h3>
  
  <p>First, confirm that the repository contains PyLucene Version 3. You can do this from terminal with the following command.</p>

<pre><code>$ apt-cache policy pylucene</code></pre>

<p>If that returned PyLucene Version 3.X.X, install PyLucene with the following command.</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo apt-get install pylucene</code></pre>
<p>And that should do it! Proceed to <a href="http://txtorg.org/linux.html#txtorg-install">install txtorg</a>.</p>

  <h3>
    <a name="dpkg" class="anchor" href="#linux-installation"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>dpkg</h3>
  
  <p>If your repository doesn't contain PyLucene Version 3, you can do the following. This will download and install the source package, using wget. If you 
  are not running a 64-bit machine, change the link accordingly.</p>

<pre><code>$ wget http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/pool/main/p/pylucene/pylucene_3.5.0-1.2_amd64.deb
$ sudo dpkg -i pylucene_3.5.0-1.2_amd64.deb</code></pre>

<p>You can now  <a href="http://txtorg.org/linux.html#txtorg-install">install txtorg</a>.</p>

  <h2>
    <a name="source" class="anchor" href="#linux-installation"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Building PyLucene from Source</h2>
  <p>If you are using a distribution of Linux other than
    Ubuntu/Debian, you'll have to install PyLucene and its
    dependencies from source. Assuming that you're using Aptitude and
    that the dependencies are in your repository, install the
    dependencies as follows in the code block below. If you're using
    another package management system or if the packages are not in
    your repos, you'll have to edit the process accordingly.
  
<pre><code>$ sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk ant g++ python-dev</code></pre>

    Next, you need to build PyLucene. First, download PyLucene
    3 <a href="http://www.dsgnwrld.com/am/lucene/pylucene/">here</a> (any
    version 3 release will do). From a shell, navigate to the
    directory in which you saved the tarball, then proceed as follows.</p>
  
<pre><code>$ cd this_is_where/I_saved_my_tarball # Navigate to the folder with the tarball
$ tar -zxvf pylucene-[PyLucene Version Here]-src.tar.gz # Untar the tarball
$ cd pylucene-4.5.1-1/jcc # Change directories in the jcc directory
$ sudo python setup.py build 
$ sudo python setup.py install
$ cd .. # Change directories back to the parent directory</code></pre>
  
  <p>Next, in a text editor, you need to edit the Makefile by
    uncommenting the section of code shown in the block below (that
    is, open the Makefile in a text editor, edit it accordingly, save,
    and close it).  Note that you'll uncomment a different portion of
    code if you're using a 32-bit machine.</p>
  
<pre><code># Linux (Ubuntu 11.10 64-bit, Python 2.7.2, OpenJDK 1.7, setuptools 0.6.16)
# Be sure to also set JDK['linux2'] in jcc's setup.py to the JAVA_HOME value
# used below for ANT (and rebuild jcc after changing it).
PREFIX_PYTHON=/usr
ANT=JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64 /usr/bin/ant
PYTHON=$(PREFIX_PYTHON)/bin/python
JCC=$(PYTHON) -m jcc --shared
NUM_FILES=4	    
</code></pre>
  
  <p>Back in the terminal, finish the PyLucene installation process by issuing the following commands.</p>
  
<pre><code>$ make
$ sudo make install
</code></pre>
<p>Now, install txtorg.</p>
  <h2>
    <a name="txtorg-install" class="anchor" href="#linux-installation"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installing txtorg</h2>
  <p>Now that you've met the dependencies for the package, you can install txtorg locally as you would any other Python module.</p>

<pre><code>$ curl -OL https://github.com/ChristopherLucas/txtorg/archive/master.zip; unzip master.zip; cd txtorg-master; python setup.py install --user</code></pre>
