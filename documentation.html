  <p>Begin by creating a new corpus. One of txtorg's strengths is its capacity to manage multiple corpora simultaneously. You can 
  create a corpus for one project, begin another, and later return to the original without reindexing, thus unifying the text management
    process into a single piece of software.</p>

  <p>To create a new corpus, click 'File' -> 'New Corpus'. You will be prompted to choose a directory in which to save the corpus, and then 
  to name it. You may put the corpus wherever you like. Note that spaces and underscores will be removed from names, so choose accordingly.</p>
  <h1>
    <a name="import-documents" class="anchor" href="#create-a-corpus"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Import Documents</h1>
  <p>Next, you must import documents. This section lays out the
  various formatting and import options. After importing documents,
  you must select the corpus, then click 'Corpus -> Rebuild Index
  File'.</p>

  <h3>
    <a name="formatting" class="anchor" href="#formatting"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Formatting Requirements</h3>
  <p>To import documents, click on the corpus to which you want to import documents (in the leftmost 'Corpus' window). The corpus should be highlighted.
  Then, click 'Corpus' -> 'Import Documents'. You'll be shown a window labeled 'SELECT PREPROCESSING OPTIONS', at the bottom of which, you select
  the 'Corpus Format'. Note that the txtorg installation contains examples for all three import options, noted in the following paragraphs. The example
  is composed of excerpts from The Brothers Karamazov (now public domain) and books and chapters to which those excerpts belong.</p>

  <p>The first import format option is 'Import an entire directory'. If you'd like to import all documents in a directory and any child directory
    located within it, select this option. Note that these documents must be .txt files, txtorg will skip all other file extensions but will import
    every .txt file located within the directory. Note this import option does not support metadata. An example of this import format can be found
    in the 'examples/brothersk/' directory contained in the zip file used to install txtorg.</p>

  <p>The second import format option is 'Import from a CSV file (not including content)'. In this format, files are uploaded
  with a csv, where the first column is 'filepaths' pointing to all of the documents that are the be uploaded. The remaining 
  columns in the csv are metadata fields, such as author name or date. In the installation directory, '/examples/brothersk_without_content.csv'
  displays this import format. This file is also shown below. Note that txtorg cannot recognize relative directory paths (such as those 
  using a period to signify the current directory) on some operating systems, and thus to upload the example corpus with this CSV, you must 
  edit the paths accordingly.</p>

<pre><code>filepath,book,chapter
./examples/brothersk/1.txt,2,2
./examples/brothersk/2.txt,2,5
./examples/brothersk/3.txt,2,7
./examples/brothersk/4.txt,3,3
./examples/brothersk/5.txt,3,9
./examples/brothersk/6.txt,4,3
./examples/brothersk/7.txt,4,8
./examples/brothersk/8.txt,4,8
./examples/brothersk/9.txt,7,3</code></pre>


  <p>The third import format option is 'Import from a CSV file (including content)'. In this format, the documents are
  represented as a field in the csv, where the values are the actual text of the corpus, and the other columns again correspond
  to document metadata. In the installation directory, '/examples/brothersk_with_content.csv' displays an example of this import 
  format. This file is also shown below and can be uploaded without modification. Note that you'll be prompted to select the 
  field containing the content, so it need not necessarily be the first column in the CSV.</p>

  <pre><code>quote,book,chapter
The man who lies to himself and listens to his own lie comes to such a pass that he cannot distinguish the truth within him or around him and so loses all respect for himself and for others. And having no respect he ceases to love and in order to occupy and distract himself without love he gives way to passions and coarse pleasures and sinks to bestiality in his vices all from continual lying to other men and to himself,2,2
All this exile to hard labor and formerly with floggings does not reform anyone and above all does not even frighten almost any criminal and the number of crimes not only does not diminish but increases all the more. Surely you will admit that. And it turns out that society thus is not protected at all for although the harmful member is mechanically cut off and sent away far out of sight another criminal appears at once to take his place perhaps even two others. If anything protects society even in our time and even reforms the criminal himself and transforms him into a different person again it is Christ's law alone which manifests itself in the acknowledgement of one's own conscience,2,5
You're a Karamazov too! In your family sensuality is carried to the point of fever. So these three sensualists are now eyeing each other with knives in their boots. The thereof them are at loggerheads and maybe you're the fourth,2,7
I'm a Karamazov. . . . when I fall into the abyss I go straight into it head down and heels up and I'm even pleased that I'm falling in such a humiliating position and for me I find it beautiful. And so in that very shame I suddenly begin a hymn. Let me be cursed let me be base and vile but let me also kiss the hem of that garment in which my God is clothed; let me be following the devil at the same time but still I am also your son Lord and I love you and I feel a joy without which the world cannot stand and be,3,3
Viper will eat viper and it would serve them both right!,3,9
My friends ask gladness from God. Be glad as children as birds in the sky. And let man's sin not disturb you in your efforts do not fear that it will dampen your endeavor and keep it from being fulfilled do not say 'Sin is strong impiety is strong the bad environment is strong and we are lonely and powerless the bad environment will dampen us and keep our good endeavor from being fulfilled.' Flee from such despondency my children! There is only one salvation for you: take yourself up and make yourself responsible for all the sins of men. For indeed it is so my friend and the moment you make yourself sincerely responsible for everything and everyone you will see at once that it is really so that it is you who are guilty on behalf of all and for all. Whereas by shifting your own laziness and powerlessness onto others you will end by sharing in Satan's pride and murmuring against God,4,3
his whole heart blazed up and turned towards some kind of light and he wanted to live and live to go on and on along some path towards the new beckoning light and to hurry hurry right now at once!,4,8
Everything is permitted,4,8
Just know one thing Rakitka I may be wicked but still I gave an onion,7,3</code></pre>

  <p>IMPORTANT: After importing documents, you must select the corpus, then click 'Corpus -> Rebuild Index File'. Also, note that in the examples above, both
  the second and the third import options yield the same corpus, while the first is identical except it has no metadata.</p>

  <h3>
    <a name="encodings" class="anchor" href="#encodings"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Encodings</h3>
  <p>txtorg supports a wide range of encodings through
  the <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/chardet">Chardet</a>
  library in Python.  Those encodings can be seen in full in the
  encodings drop down menu on the import documents menu and are shown
  in the table below. In general, UTF-8 is preferable, in the event
  that you have a choice. If you select 'Automatically Detect
  Encodings', txtorg will guess the encodings of your corpus, with
  some error. Note that the corpus must be in one encoding, so txtorg
  will fail if you ask it to detect the encodings of a corpus
  containing multiple encodings. Because it isn't possible to detect
  encodings perfectly, it is better to designate the encoding if possible.</p>
