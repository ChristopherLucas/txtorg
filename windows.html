  <p>To install the Whoosh version of txtorg, simply follow these short instructions.</p>

  <ol>
    <li><a href="https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.6/">Install Python</a> (ideally 2.7 but definitely not 3.x)</li>
    <li>To <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/install/#standard-build-and-install">install the package</a>,
      first open a command prompt (Start > All Programs > Accessories > Command Prompt). Next, navigate to the directory "ChristopherLucas-txtorg-4dbad8b". To do so, use the
      cd command, followed by the full path to the directory. Then, install the package with the command setup.py install. These steps are show in the code block below.</li>
  
<pre><code>$ cd this_is_where/I_unzipped_the_file/ChristopherLucas-txtorg-4dbad8b # Navigate to the folder 
$ setup.py install
</code></pre>
    <li>Open the directory where you unzipped the file, go to bin, and rename txtorg to txtorg.py. Double click this file to run txtorg.</li>
  </ol>  
<p>And that should do it!</p>

<p>To extend txtorg to use with Lucene as well as Whoosh, follow the following steps instead.</p>

  <ol>
    <li><a href="https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.6/">Install Python</a> (ideally 2.7 but definitely not 3.x)</li>
    <li>Install setuptools: Download <a href="https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/raw/bootstrap/ez_setup.py">https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/raw/bootstrap/ez_setup.py</a> and double-click it! This will install easy_install.exe, which you'll need in step 5.</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.java.com/en/">Install Java</a> (if it's not installed)</li>
    <li>Locate the jvm.dll file (mine is in C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre1.6.0_24\bin\client). You'll need this in the next step.</li>
    <li>Add the dll location and the easy_install location to the Path. easy_install.exe is probably located in C:\Python27\Scripts, but if not, use the search box
      on the Start menu to find it. If you haven't edited the Path variable before, follow these steps to do so.
      <ul>
      <li>From the Desktop, right click on My Computer, click Properties</li>
      <li>Under Advanced System Settings, Environment Variables</li>
      <li>Click PATH in the list of System Variables</li>
      <li>Click edit, and change the path by adding the dll location and the easy_install location, as shown in the
	code block below. IMPORTANT: note that file paths must be separated semicolons. In the example below, there
	are two paths, not one. 
<pre><code>;C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre1.6.0_24\bin\client;C:\Python27\ArcGIS10.2\Scripts</pre></code></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Download <a href="/installation/lucene_install.py">this file</a> 
      and double click it</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/ChristopherLucas/txtorg/zipball/master">Download the zip file</a> and unzip it. This should create a directory named "ChristopherLucas-txtorg-4dbad8b".</li>
    <li>Finally, you must install txtorg (as you would any Python package). To <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/install/#standard-build-and-install">install the package</a>,
      first open a command prompt (Start > All Programs > Accessories > Command Prompt). Next, navigate to the directory "ChristopherLucas-txtorg-4dbad8b". To do so, use the
      cd command, followed by the full path to the directory. Then, install the package with the command setup.py install. These steps are show in the code block below.</li>
  
<pre><code>$ cd this_is_where/I_unzipped_the_file/ChristopherLucas-txtorg-4dbad8b # Navigate to the folder 
$ setup.py install
</code></pre>
    <li>Open the directory where you unzipped the file, go to bin, and rename txtorg to txtorg.py. Double click this file to run txtorg.</li>
  </ol>  
<p>And that should do it!</p>

    <a name="windows-update" class="anchor" href="#windows-update"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Updating Versions on a Windows Machine</h1>
  
  <p>Because txtorg is still in active development, you should update
    often (for notifications about updates, sign up for
    our <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/txtorg-mailing-list">mailing
    list</a>). On a Windows machine, update by following the steps
    below.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Delete the directory containing the current install. You can leave the program files, these will be overwritten.</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/ChristopherLucas/txtorg/zipball/master">Download the zip file</a> and unzip it.</li>
    <li>From the command line, navigate to the directory created when you unzipped the file. This should contain setup.py. Following the same process used for the initial install, install txtorg.
    This is shown in the steps below.</li>
    <pre><code>$ cd this_is_where/I_unzipped_the_file/ChristopherLucas-txtorg-4dbad8b # Navigate to the folder 
$ setup.py install
</code></pre>
    <li>Open the directory where you unzipped the file, go to bin, and rename txtorg to txtorg.py. Double click this file to run txtorg.</li>
  </ol>
