txtorg
======

txtorg is a Python-based utility that leverages Apache Lucene to facilitate text preprocessing and management. It outputs processed text in a variety of formats for use in a wide array of analytical software, including (but not limited to) the structural topic model. It scales to large corpora and has a graphical user interface that anyone can use. With Lucene, txtorg can support a wide range of languages. For more information on txtorg and text analysis, especially (but not exclusively) with data in political science, we point users to a working paper that describes the software and various applications in greater detail.
